## Introduction
As home-sharing rental sites become more popular, the housing market of urban areas change more and more. Gentrification is a rising problem in many American cities today. While gentrification is usually attributed to an influx of new affluent residents into a neighborhood, the purchase of properties in a neighborhood solely to house short-term visitors may also be an overlooked factor. Using this resource, we want to answer **QUESTION HERE**.  
In this resource, we will specifically look at Airbnb's impact on Seattle's neighborhoods{, starting from 2011}.  

## Our Dataset
The dataset we are using is provided by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) (2019). It includes information about Airbnb listings in Seattle. It has been cleaned to remove columns not relevant to our research. {We also added X new columns: `x`, `x`, and `x`. (add if true)}  
Below is a sample of our dataset.
